# Flight Price Prediction

# Introduction
Optimal timing for airline ticket purchasing from the consumer’s perspective is challenging
principally because buyers have insufficient information for reasoning about future price
movements. In this project we majorly targeted to uncover underlying trends of flight prices in
India using historical data and also to suggest the approximate price of a flight ticket.

The project implements the validations or contradictions towards myths regarding the airline
industry, a comparison study among various models in predicting the optimal time to buy the
flight ticket and the amount that can be saved if done so. A customized model which included
a combination of ensemble and statistical models have been implemented with a best accuracy
of above 90% for a few routes, mostly from metro to metro cities. These models have led to
significant savings and produced average positive savings on each transaction.

Remarkably, the trends of the prices are highly sensitive to the route, month of departure, day
of departure, time of departure, whether the day of departure is a holiday and airline carrier.
Highly competitive routes like most business routes (tier 1 to tier 1 cities like Mumbai(India)-Delhi(India))
had a non-decreasing trend where prices increased as days to departure decreased.

With a high probability (about 20-25%) that a person has to wait to buy a ticket, the scope of
the project can be extensively extended across the various routes to make significant savings
on the purchase of flight prices across the Indian Domestic Airline market.

# Problem Definition
Anyone who has booked a flight ticket knows how unexpectedly the prices vary. Airlines use
using sophisticated quasi-academic tactics known as "revenue management" or "yield
management". The cheapest available ticket for a given date gets more or less expensive over
time. This usually happens as an attempt to maximize revenue based on –
1. Time of purchase patterns (making sure last-minute purchases are expensive)
2. Keeping the flight as full as they want it (raising prices on a flight which is filling up in
order to reduce sales and hold back inventory for those expensive last-minute expensive
purchases).

So, if we could inform the travelers with the optimal time to buy their flight tickets based on
the historic data and also show them various trends in the airline industry, we could help them
save money on their travels. This would be a practical implementation of a data analysis,
statistics and machine learning techniques to solve a daily problem faced by travelers.
1. Flight Trends Do airfares change frequently?
2. Do they move in small increments or in large jumps?
3. Do they tend to go up or down over time?
4. Best Time to Buy: What is the best time to buy so that the consumer can save the
most by taking the least risk? So should a passenger wait to buy his ticket, or should
he buy as early as possible?
5. Verifying myths does price increase as we get near to departure date? Is Indigo
cheaper than Jet Airways? Are morning flights expensive?
